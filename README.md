#### **FONTS**

* I decided i would use the Google fonts [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=Whose%20paying%20the%20bill&preview.text_type=custom). Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

#### **2.1 Navbar** 

* The navbar is a simple Bootstrap navbar that is responsive and will change depending on the screen size. As this is an SPA there was no need to add extra pages to the Navbar.
